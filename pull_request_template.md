### Submission summary
We modified the ansatz and feature map according to the "Supervised learning with quantum enhanced feature spaces" paper and we played a little with the parameters for learing (i.e. number of iterations, batch size, depth).

It should have an accuracy of about 70%.

The ansatz uses a depth of 1.
